//! Message format:
//!
//! The type of message depends on the first byte:
//!
//! - 0: Creates a framebuffer. Next 4 bytes are a "framebuffer ID" as decided by the message
//! emitter. Next 4 bytes are the width in little endian. Next 4 bytes are the height in little
//! endian.
//! - 1: Destroys a framebuffer. Next 4 bytes are the framebuffer ID.
//! - 2: Set framebuffer content. Next 4 bytes are the framebuffer ID. The rest is 3 * width *
//! height values. The rest is RGB triplets.
//! - 3: Send back the next input event. Next 4 bytes are the framebuffer ID. The answer consists
//! in an input event whose format is a SCALE-encoding of the [`Event`] struct below.
//!
//! There actually exists two interfaces that use the same messages format: with events, or without
//! events. Messages whose first byte is `3` are invalid in the "without events" interface.
