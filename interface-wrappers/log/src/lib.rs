//! Logging.
//!
//! This interface allows a program to send out messages for the purpose of being logged.
//!
//! How these logs are handled is at the discretion of the rest of the system, but the intent is
//! for them to be shown to a human being if desired.
//!
//! # The `log` crate
//!
//! This interface provides a backend for the `log` crate.
//!
//! Example usage:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! redshirt_log_interface::init();
//! log::debug!("debug log message here");
//! ```
