//! Kernel logging.
//!
//! This interface permits two things:
//!
//! - Send logs for the kernel to print.
//! - Configure how the kernel prints logs.
//!
//! It is important for programs such as video drivers to keep the kernel up-to-date with how
//! logs should be displayed. In the case of a kernel panic, the kernel will use the information
//! contained in the latest received message in order to show diagnostics to the user.
