//! Core components of a redshirt kernel.
//!
//! The main structure of this crate is [`System`]. A [`System`] represents a running operating
//! system, and is a collection of *programs* exchanging messages between each others.
//!
//! > **Note**: A [`System`] doesn't run automatically in the background. You must call the
//! >           [`System::run`] function repeatedly in order for the programs within the
//! >           [`System`] to advance.
//!
//! Programs within a [`System`] are written in [the Wasm language](https://webassembly.org/),
//! or, more likely, written in a programming language then compiled to Wasm. In order to start
//! a Wasm program, pass the binary either to [`SystemBuilder::with_startup_process`] if you're
//! building a [`System`], or to [`System::execute`] if the [`System`] is already constructed.
//!
//! Each program within a [`System`] gets attributed a single [`Pid`] that identifies it.
//!
//! # Messages
//!
//! As part of their execution, programs (both Wasm and native) can emit *messages*. A message can
//! accept either zero or one response. Each emitted message gets attribute a single unique
//! [`MessageId`] that identifies it.
//!
//! In order to emit a message, you must pass three main information:
//!
//! - The hash of a target *interface* (more on that below).
//! - The body of the message, opaque to the `redshirt_core` crate. The way it must be interpreted
//! depends on the target *interface*.
//! - Whether or not a response is expected.
//!
//! Contrary to many other operating systems, messages don't target a specific program, but rather
//! an *interface* that can be referred to with an [`InterfaceHash`].
//!
//! There exists a few *interfaces* hardcoded within the [`System`]. When a program emits a
//! message targetting one of these interfaces, the message will be treated (and answer, if
//! necessary) by the [`System`] itself. Here is a list:
//!
//! - `interface`. The interface named `interface` allows programs to register themselves as
//! provider of an interface. If a program then emits a message targetting the interface, then
//! the registered program will be in charge of treating the message.
//! - `threads`. The interface named `threads` provides a few utilities related to multithreading
//! (TODO: this isn't really done yet)
//!
//! > **Note**: A very common workflow for a program is, immediately after it starts, to emit a
//! >           message on the `interface` interface in order to register itself as the handler of
//! >           a specific interface. It will then be in charge of processing the messages coming
//! >           on that registered interface.
//!
//! > **Note**: Only one program at a time can be registered as an interface handler. This is done
//! >           in a first-come-first-serve manner. If a second program tries to register itself
//! >           for the same interface, the second registration will fail.
//!
//! # Wasm programs isolation
//!
//! Wasm programs are isolated entirely within their virtual machine, and have no access to the
//! outside except for passing messages around.
//! Any action requiring intervention from the hardware can only be done directly by a
//! *native program*.
//!
//! Because of their non-isolated nature, the list of *native programs* should be composed only
//! of the strict minimum, and can't be changed once the [`System`] has been constructed.
//!
//! # Lazy interfaces registration
//!
//! Since programs all start simultaneously at the system initialization, and because we don't
//! know in advance which interface(s) (if any) a program will register and when, it is possible
//! for a program to emit a message on an interface that has no registered handler but that will
//! have one soon in the future.
//!
//! > **Example**: Program A is an HTTP server and wants to open a TCP socket to start listening
//! >              for incoming connections. To do so, program A emits a message of the interface
//! >              named `tcp`. Program B is the network manager and registers itself as the
//! >              provider of the `tcp` interface. Since A and B start at the same time, it is
//! >              possible for A to emit its message before B has registered itself.
//!
//! In order to solve this problem, emitting a message will block the execution of the current
//! thread until a handler is available for the target interface. It is possible, when emitting
//! a message, to disable this behaviour and fail immediately if no handler is registered.
//!
//! Additionally, no timeout mechanism exists. In other words, if no program registers itself as
//! the handler of an interface for which a message has been emitted, then the sending thread
//! will block forever.
//!
//! > **Note**: As a general rule in IT, the only two timeout values that make sense are *0*
//! >           and *infinite*.
//!
//! While this hasn't been implemented yet, the best way to deal with this kind of situation is
//! to somehow report to the user the list of programs being stuck waiting for an interface
//! handler.
