//! Standalone redshirt kernel building tookit.
//!
//! This library provides a toolkit that lets one create a stand-alone redshirt kernel. Two things
//! are provided:
//!
//! - A `__gen_boot!` macro that gets passed a bunch of information about the target platform, and
//! generates a function exported under the symbol `_start`.
//! - A `run` function, suitable to be passed to the `gen_boot!` macro, that runs the kernel after
//! an environment has been setup.
//!
//! It is intended that in the future this crate allows more customizations, and a more
//! fine-grained split of components.
//!
//! # Kernel environment
//!
//! When the `_gen_boot!` macro is used, a symbol named `_start` is generated. The user is
//! responsible for ensuring that execution jumps to this symbol, after which the code of the
//! macro is in total control of the hardware.
//!
//! No assumption is made about the state of the registers, memory, or hardware when `_start` is
//! executed.
//!
//! The only exception concerns the x86 and x86_64 platform, where `_start` is expected to be
//! loaded from a multiboot2-compatible loader.
//! See <https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot2/multiboot.html> for more information.
//!
//! Additionally, this crate defines [a panic handler](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/runtime.html#the-panic_handler-attribute)
//! and a [global allocator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/runtime.html#the-global_allocator-attribute).
//! It is not possible to set your own panic handler or global allocator when having this crate
//! as a dependency.
