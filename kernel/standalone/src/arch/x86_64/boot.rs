//! This file contains the entry point of our kernel.
//!
//! Once the bootloader finishes loading the kernel (as an ELF file), it will run its entry point,
//! which is the `_start` function defined in this file.
//!
//! Since we are conforming to the multiboot2 specifications, the bootloader is expected to set the
//! ebx register to the memory address of a data structure containing information about the
//! environment.
//!
//! The environment in which we start in is the protected mode where the kernel is identity-mapped.
//!
//! The role of the `_start` function below is to perform some checks, set up everything that is
//! needed to run freestanding 64bits Rust code (i.e. a stack, paging, long mode), and call the
//! [`super::entry_point_step3`] Rust function.
